My name is Ylan Segal. I am a Software Engineer based in beautiful San Diego, California, where I lived most of my adult life. I grew up in Mexico City.

I have a Bachelors degree in Civil Engineering from the [Univerisdad Iberoamericana][uia] in Mexico City, and a Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics degree from [Stanford University][stanford]. I've been writing software for over 20 years.
