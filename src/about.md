I'm Ylan Segal, a Software Engineer in San Diego, California, where I've lived most of my adult life. I grew up in Mexico City. You can reach me on Bluesky at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ylan.segal-family.com">@ylan.segal.family.com</a>, Mastodon at <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@ylansegal">@ylansegal@mastodon.sdf.org</a>, or by email at `ylan@{this top domain}`.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Universidad Iberoamericana][uia] in Mexico City and a Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics from [Stanford University][stanford]. I've been writing software for over 20 years.

I'm a Software Engineer at [Apple][apple]. Before that, I was a Staff Software Engineer at [Procore][procore] and a Development Expert at [SAP][sap] through its acquisition of Mellmo, makers of [Roambi][roambi]. Earlier, I was a partner in an e-commerce venture. See my complete work history on [LinkedIn][linkedin] or my public code on [GitHub][github].

I write about things that interest me as a software engineer. All content and opinions are my own.
