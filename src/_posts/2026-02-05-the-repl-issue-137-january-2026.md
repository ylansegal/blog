### [AI is a horse](https://kconner.com/2024/08/02/ai-is-a-horse.html)

This is very clever!

### [Karpathy on Claude](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876)

AI capabilities are moving fast. Its hard to keep up and develop personal workflows. I find it useful to read what others are doing and take what fits me.

### [Taming Claude Code](https://thisalex.com/posts/claude-taming/)

In the same vein as above. I'm experimenting with creating skills after reading.
