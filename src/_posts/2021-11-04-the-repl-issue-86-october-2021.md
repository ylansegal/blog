### [Bitcoin is a Ponzi][1]

I've been thinking about this a lot: Bitcoin (and other crypto) seem like a Ponzi scheme. Is it? Jorge Stolfi make the argument that it is, and I find it compelling.

### [Understanding How Facebook Disappeared from the Internet][2]

Interesting explanation of how BGP and DNS work, and how it it possible for a company like Facebook disappeared completely off the internet, and what it looked like for Cloudflare, one of the biggest content-delivery networks on the internet.

### [We Tried Baseball and It Didn't Work][3]

> An allegory? Sarcasm? Humorous pastiche? You decide.

I call it satire. Like most funny ones, it resonates because it has a kernel of truth, exaggerated to absurdity. Squarely aimed at those that criticize Agile, TDD, or any other discipline without actually understanding it.
