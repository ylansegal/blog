### [Phoenix and Rails performance comparison][1]

Benchmarks are always to be taken with a grain of salt: They think that they are measuring can be very far from the performance you are likely to see in production. Their usefulness is in informing our decisions about technology choices. I have been getting interested lately in Elixir and the Phoenix Framework and the results of this benchmark confirm my anecdotal experience: Phoenix, out of the gate, blows Rails out of the water. Very interesting considering that the code you write in Phoenix applications is very pleasant, like Rails. Developer happiness, right?

### [This Is Professionalism][2]

This short post by Chris Doyle captures very succinctly what professionalism is: Autonomy, responsability  and humilty. It resonated with me. As I [mentioned before][4], excellence and professionalism in Software Engineering don't require a medieval craftsmanship metaphor.

### [Designing a Secure REST (Web) API without OAuth][3]

I have been doing a lot of research lately on API authentication and came across this article. It's a bit rambling at times, but it's filled with good information of what issues can arise with API authentication and was food for a lot of thought and further research.
