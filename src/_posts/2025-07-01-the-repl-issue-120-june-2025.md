### [My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/)

According to the author, AI skeptics are not making good arguments. AI is useful. Its not perfect, but that is not the point. It can help developers deliver value quicker.

And it's not just Chat. Agentic AI is a game changer. I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and it's already changing how I code. It's not perfect. But still useful.

This. Is. Changing. So. Fast.

### [Thrive In Obscurity](https://www.jeetmehta.com/posts/thrive-in-obscurity)

The gist is that you should focus on what interests you, and write (or code about that). Be happy no because people follow you, but because what you are producing is interesting to you. Maybe the world will agree. More than likely it will not, but that should not be your goal.

I've managed to blog consistently since 2012. 13 years. I've amassed a lot of content. Nothing has gone viral. I don't care. It has helped me become a better writer. Maybe find a job (but maybe not). It has helped me think, by making some ideas concrete and publishing them. Even if it's only for the robots to crawl.
