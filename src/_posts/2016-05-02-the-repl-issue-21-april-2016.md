### [The Optimistâ€™s Guide to Pessimistic Library Versioning][1]

Richard Schneeman, writes a well though out post on library versioning. He [previously][4] wrote about Semver and now continues on that vein with how it applies in practice for library authors and users. The key take-away is that adhering to Semver and the widespread use of optimistic locking can alleviate a great deal of the pain of maintaining and upgrading dependencies for projects.

### [Detecting the use of "curl | bash" server side][2]

Internet security is fascinating. I have read advise that before using `curl` to download a file and piping directly to `bash`, you must ensure that you know what you are downloading. However, as this post proves, looking at the URL in your browser is not enough. By using a clever trick to detect how data is being pulled from a server, an attacker can present different content when URL is being downloaded and piped to `bash`. Security is hard. Really Hard.

### [Git history is underrated][3]

Author's thoughts on what a project's log of commit messages are: A history of _why_ the code in the repository is the way it is. For the reasons outlined, I prefer never to squash commits when merging.
