### [Cost of a Join][1]

Brian Davis writes a detailed post of how expensive it is to do join queries in postgres. The details are very interesting, as is the conclusion: Join operations are usually cheap.


### [Elixir: a few things about GenStage I wish I knew some time ago][2]

I've recently started working on an Elixir project that seems perfectly suited to use [GenStage][genstage]. In this article Andrei Chernykh complements the [GenStage documentation][genstage] and explains how to use it in an approachable manner.

### [What they donâ€™t tell you about event sourcing][3]

Hugo Rocha writes about the pitfalls of using event sourcing. Like most engineering techniques, it is not a perfect fit for every situation. In fact, I believe event sourcing is a sufficiently different paradigm to traditional CRUD applications that it makes it difficult to approach in a iterative manner that other techniques can be incorporated into existing systems.

### [Why JWTs Suck as Session Tokens][4]

Randall Degges writes a good primer on what JWT tokens are, what security guarantees they give, and what problem they are a good solution for. Namely, using them in distributed systems to reduce inter-service calls to verify authentication (or other claims). As the title not-so-subtly suggests, they are not great as session tokens. Most web frameworks already have this problem solved. There is no need to re-invent wheels that are rolling just fine.
