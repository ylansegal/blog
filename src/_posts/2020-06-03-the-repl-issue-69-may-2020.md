I think this is one of the most important points in the article: Writing things down helps develop a train of thought and connect things together. Holes in logic or implicit conjectures become evident. Writing for the consumption of others, increases this effect.

I've found that collaborating on well-written work is easier than collaborating on work that is hard to follow, doesn't spell out assumptions, doesn't show examples, etc.
