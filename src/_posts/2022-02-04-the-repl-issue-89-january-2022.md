### [The UX on this Small Child Is Terrible](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-ux-on-this-small-child-is-terrible)

This is pretty funny. Reminds me of [Introducing JIRA Jr. Project Tracking... for kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9shZslfbaS0)

### [In Defence of the Boring Web](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2022/boring/)

I made the exact same decisions as the author to create this very website: Markdown source, a static site generator, little javascript (in my case none), and a minimalist theme. However, I don't think **boring** is a good word. My dictionary defines it as:

> not interesting; tedious: I've got a boring job in an office.

Instead, I would use a word that connotes tried-and-true, simple, adequate for the job. **Reliable** comes to mind.

### [On the Various OSS Fauna](https://mailchi.mp/railsspeed/on-the-various-oss-fauna?e=ecb13d72a8)

I didn't know about WikiFauna. I like the idea a lot: To outline the different roles that people can take to contribute to the project. I am not sure about **fauna** as a term, or that calling folks elves, cyclops, fairies, gnomes is useful at all.

Nate Berkopec does a great job in adapting the idea to OSS and correctly points out that most OSS is volunteer work: You decide your level of involvement.
