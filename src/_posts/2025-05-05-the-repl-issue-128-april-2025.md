Of course, less communication paths also means less collaboration and silos. There is no silver bullet, but knowing about the phenomena makes it easier to organize towards goals.

### [Ruby might be faster than you think]()

Like the a not-for-polite-company adage says, everyone has a benchmark. A recent project made the rounds adding support for using crystal to speed up Ruby very easily. The author of this post shows, that a bit of work on what is actually benchmarked makes it so the Ruby-only version performs faster than the Crystal version. Well, that is interesting. Which benchmark should you trust? The one that is appropriate for your use case, naturally <span class="emoji">ðŸ˜„</span>.

### [An unfair advantage: multi-tenant queues in Postgres](https://docs.hatchet.run/blog/multi-tenant-queues)

I didn't look very closely at the algorithm, but the idea is that if you distribute jobs at write time, you save work at read-time, making the dequeuing faster, and avoids doing coordination work when you read. I've seen this too in production systems that have very "hot" queues.
