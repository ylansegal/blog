I recently learned that Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) is a thing -- about 10 years old. It caught me by surprise. Not because I find it novel, but because I've always followed these principles.

In 1995 I learned about the web. Connecting to the internet meant using the same phone line for calls. You connected on-demand, when you wanted to check email or browse. Most people got their email address from their ISP. I realized that switching ISPs would mean changing my email. So I got an address I thought would last forever: `ylan@email.com`. People didn't believe me when I told them that was actually my address! I forget what happened to `email.com`, and the domain now sits unused (it redirects to `company.ai`). But at some point, the terms of service didn't agree with me. Being technically minded, I realized the only way to avoid churning my email address was to buy my own domain. I could (and have) changed providers, but my email would stay the same. At the close of last century I bought `segal-family.com`, and have used it ever since.

In 2021, I decided to start this blog. When looking for hosting providers, CMSs, and static site generators, I read some advice: Whatever you pick, make sure you own your content. Don't let a third party own it who might change their terms later. Given my email address experience, this seemed obvious. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

Don't get me wrong -- I'm not putting anyone down for reviving an older idea. I'm happy that POSSE has been gathering steam. It's better for the web. I look forward to a more interconnected future. And if it helps to have a catchy acronym, that's great too.
