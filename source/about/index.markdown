I am Ylan Segal, a Software Engineer based in beautiful San Diego, California.

I write occasionally in this blog about things that interest me as a developer: Technologies I am using,
the tools of the trade, problem solving, testing, books. See the sidebar for a list of categories.

If you found something interesting, you can reach me on twitter [@ylansegal][5] or by email at ylan@{this domain}. I'd be happy to have a conversation.
