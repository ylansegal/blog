I follow a certain number of ruby-related blogs and have noticed lots of calls to use Vim as an editor. One one hand, I see the appeal: I use a bunch of unix tools and scripts in my daily workflow and it makes sense to use a editor that works inside my terminal. I have tried a few tutorials, screencasts and what not, but I have never felt really comfortable. Something has always been off. I always assumed it was due to the big learning curve others talk about.

On the other hand, when I switched from TextMate to Sublime Text, there was almost no drop in productivity. Part of it has to do with similar functionality being mapped to the same keys, like command-t. However, I believe that there is more to it.

## Modes

Vim operates on a different paradigm than any other text editing application out there: It has modes. Normal. Insert. Command. It is the source of it's power, it is said. That may be. It is also one the biggest barriers: Every other place on my computer were text is entered and edited works in a different manner. You just enter the writing area, and type. This works for my email client, my word processor, my spreadsheet, my chat client, my terminal and all the places that my browsers takes me.

In addition, OS X provides lots of shortcuts that work *across* all these applications. Want to delete the last character? Hit [delete]. Want to delete the last word? [option]-[delete]. Delete the whole line? [command]-[delete]. It works everywhere. On Sublime Text, on Email, on JIRA. If you learn Vim's particular key combinations, it makes you more efficient in Vim. Learning the *universal* shortcuts make you more efficient everywhere.

## Conclusion

Software Engineers spend a great deal of their time writing and editing text, but a non-trivial amount is done outside your main editor or IDE. We write many emails, type on chat windows, use our browser for issue tracking. Your OS already provides a lot of keyboard shortcuts for dealing with text that is common to all these activities. By leveraging those were possible, as opposed to the application specific ones, you boost your productivity across the board and reduce contexts shifting.
