### [Redis Streams and the Unified Log][1]

In this article, @brandur writes about the unified log concept and how to use Redis streams (coming soon) to build a foundation for a unified log. He covers _what_ a unified log is good for, compares it to Kafka and provides code examples that tie everything together. This is great quality writing. I highly recommend you read the other articles on his blog. They are worth it.
