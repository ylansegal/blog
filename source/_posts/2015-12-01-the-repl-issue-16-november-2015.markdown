### [Phoenix Is Not Rails][1]

I have been following the Elixir community and the Phoenix framework in particular. I feel a certain familiarity between Ruby and Elixir, and Rails and Phoenix. Chris McCord, the creator of Phoenix writes, a thoughtful post on the differences, and more importantly *why they matter*. Sometimes, differences in Software Engineering can be esthetic only (e.g. plural vs singular database table names); Not so with these. He makes compelling arguments on the technical choices made in Phoenix.

### [How To Charge For Open Source][2]

Mike Perham, the creator and maintainer of Sidekiq, explains how to go about making a business out of Open Source Software. Uncharacteristically for the internet, the comments for this post are actually very interesting, as are the links. For a more in-depth conversation into the same topic, hear (or read the transcript) of Mike's [guest appearance][4] at the Ruby Rogues Podcast

### [What Is SemVer][3]

SemVer, short for Semantic Versioning, is a convention for software version numbering. I have been using it very successfully at work with for internal gems and bundler pessimistic locking (`~>` operator). In this post Richard Schneeman, explains the practical aspects of choosing a release number, including security releases.
