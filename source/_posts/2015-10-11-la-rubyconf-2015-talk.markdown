Yesterday, I had the pleasure and privilege of presenting at [LA RubyConf][1] 2015. The conference was great. The [presentation slides][2] for my talk, *Practical Unix for Ruby and Rails* is now available.

It is powered by the awesome [Remark.js][3], which has awesome features, like presenter mode that shows you notes next to each slide. Hit [P] to see my notes for the slides.
