### [Karafka][karakfa]

Karafka is a framework used to simplify Apache Kafka based Ruby applications development. It looks like a Rails-like abstraction to remove some of the boilerplate and decisions around how to structure a Kafka application. I don't know if it's ready for production, but worth keeping an eye on it.

### [MiniTest is not "Just Ruby", it is "Just Rails"][minitest]

Victor Shepelev writes his opinion about RSpec and MiniTest and how the differ. I don't subscribe to all the author's opinions or conclusions, but I do prefer RSpec and I have never found the "It's just Ruby" argument for MiniTest very convincing. If anything, I find that having a distinct shape, structure and feel for test is a net positive. It promotes shifting from "This is the part that specifies behavior" to "This is the part that implements behavior" in a cleaner way.

### [Be Kind][kind]

Being a good and kind person pays dividends. I love this story. You should read it.
