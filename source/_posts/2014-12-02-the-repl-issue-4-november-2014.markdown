### [Lagom is not Just for Swedes][1]

Great article on DHH's RailsConf 2014 keynote. Even though you can have a badly designed system _with_ tests, let's not throw out the baby with the bath water.

### [Collaboration is Other People][2]

Jon Yurek writes a thoughful opinion about the use of style-guides. It's not about the pendantry of the use of curly braces or spaces, but about working as a team, better communications and focus on the important things in the code.

### [36% smaller Rails memory footprint through Benchmarking][3]

Great tale about finding a great win by running benchmarks, the power of open-source collaboration. One small pull request will benefit thousands of rails apps in the future :)

### [In defense of fat tools][4]

The Unix philosophy is to build small things and connect them together. How small? That is the crux of the matter. In this post, Avdi shows why sometimes using slightly larger tools, correctly abstracted away can yield better results than roll-your-own simpler alternatives.
