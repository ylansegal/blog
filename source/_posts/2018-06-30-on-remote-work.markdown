A few months ago I changed jobs. My previous job was at a large software company, with offices worldwide. My day-to-day activities routinely included conference calls with people in the Americas, Europe and Asia. For the most part, these were coordinations meetings. My most meaningful collaborations -- in contrast -- were with the people sitting around me: The members of my team.

My situation now is quite different. I work for a much smaller company, in number of total employees. My team all works at headquarters, but I come in most days to a company office located in a different city. In practice, this makes me a remote worker. I've had time to make some observations about that type of work. My experience relates specifically to software engineering, but I imagine that it could also apply to other similar type of work.

## Embrace Asynchronous Communication

When working in the same office, it's relatively easy to tell when it's appropriate to interrupt someone: They are preparing coffee, returning from a break, or are in between meetings. When working remotely, I am more careful about other's time, since I don't want to break their concentration. This is especially true if I need some input, but don't need it right now.

Asynchronous, written communication helps. I can send someone an email or ask a question in a PR. While they respond, I can continue with other tasks. At first, this switching between tasks was a bit difficult. With practice and a good organization system, this has become much easier. Now, I generally work on my tasks until I need input, request it asynchronously and switch to something else in the meantime.

## Video Calls

The next best thing to in-person communication is video calls. There is a certain awkwardness inherent in them. In particular it bothers me greatly that because of where the camera is positioned, participant never seem to look each other in the eyes. That nitpick notwithstanding, video chat is much richer than just audio: Seeing other's facial expressions conveys a lot of meaning. Using your computer as a communication device has some issues. I always have many screen open. When on video calls, it's easy to allow myself to get distracted and peak into another window: Email, chat, the code I was working on. Pretty soon, I've stoped paying attention to the conversation. To avoid that, I've started combating the temptation by minimizing all windows except for the video call, having the video window in the same screen as the camera -- to simulate as much as possible looking at the other people in the eyes. This has made me much more engaged in conversations. If I still need to fidget with something, I doodle on paper or turn to my current favorite fidget: A Rubik's cube.

For video calls to be effective, they need to be high quality. A reliable internet connection is needed, but not enough. There is no shortage of video call providers. I've tried many. Their quality is much different, and it makes a big difference. Poor audio quality, or "lossy" connections make it hard to have good conversations. In my experience, [Zoom](https://zoom.us) quality is much better than others, including Slack and Skype.

In the same vein, as a software engineer, I find myself talking about code a lot. Sharing my screen, or seeing other's screen, has been essential to good communication. A picture is worth a thousand words.
