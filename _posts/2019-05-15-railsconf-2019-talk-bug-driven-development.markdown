Last week I had the pleasure of attending [RailsConf 2019][rails_conf_session] for the first time, and the honor to be a speaker. My talk was titled "Bug-Driven Development". On the surface it’s ostensibly a war story about fixing a particularly nasty bug. At a deeper level, it is about software design evolution. Software is an iterative endeavor, perpetually in a state of flux. Requirements change, new features are added, external APIs are deprecated, scaling demands adjustments. In the talk, I try to thread the needle between a specific bug fix and the broader applicability of design patterns, proper abstractions, and the role of testing. My goal was for audience members to be able to see both the proverbial forest and the trees: to connect the ivory-tower, abstract design concepts with the day-to-day practice of writing code, test-driven development, and fixing bugs.

RailsConf itself was a great experience. The organizers did a great job, both from an attendee, and a speaker perspective. Attending the conference gave me an opportunity to learn about new topics, dive deeper on familiar ones, connect with other rubyists, and hopefully contribute my own grain of sand to the community from which I have gained so much. This may have been my first RailsConf, but I am sure I’ll come back in the future.

Last — but not least, I am grateful of all the support received from [Procore][procore]. The continuous drive to engineering excellence is inspiring and contagious. Its commitment and investment to the personal development of the engineering team made this talk possible.
