*Architecting The Cloud. Design decisions for cloud computing service models*, by Michael J. Kavis describes cloud computing in general and the different service models that are prevalent today in particular. It explores the differences and trade-offs between Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). I consider the book a good introduction to considerations for cloud computing for those that are used to more traditional data-center deployments.

The author covers a section on worst practices: Things that do not translate well when moving to the cloud and recommendations on how to avoid them. I found the most useful chapter to be the one on disaster recovery: A good overview of different strategies to become fault-tolerant in the cloud and embracing resiliency.
