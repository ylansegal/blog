> Perfect practice makes perfect

I have recently discovered [exercism.io][1], by [Katrina Owen][2] of [Ruby Rogues][3] fame.

*Exercism* is a great way to practice your code and get feedback on it from others. You work on one exercise at the time and re-submit for review as often as needed until your code is considered great code. You then move on to the next exercise.

It's awesome because you get feedback on your code, but also because you get to *give* feedback on other's code and get to benefit form seeing others code evolve.

So far, it's been a really fun experience. Thank you Katrina.
