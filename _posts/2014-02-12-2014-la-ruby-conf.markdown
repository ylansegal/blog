Last Saturday I had the pleasure to attend [LA Ruby Conf][1] for the first time. The conference has two days of workshops, which I did not attend and one day of single-track talks.

I had a great time and think the organizers did a great job. The talks were varied and interesting, with enough breaks to also take advantage of the "hallway track". It's always great to talk to the other developers.

[Confreaks][2] taped videos of the talks, but they are not yet available.

See you next year, [@larubyconf][3]
